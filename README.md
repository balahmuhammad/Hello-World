# Hello-World
Hello world, I'm Balah Muhammad, and I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. I have a strong passion for traveling and making people smile. I love to spend time with my family, and I enjoy playing sports. I'm 20 years old, and I have 3 siblings. I hope one day to be a stand up comedian.
